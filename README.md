The internet is now a part of everyone's life and entertainment in a short amount of time is increasingly becoming popular.
With TikTok, Instagram reels and Cameo, the shift to consumption of "rapid fire" content is apparent. 
News has also always been made to capture attention and then indulge the reader. This is done either with catchy titles/headlines or an interesting one-liner.

This project intends to search and summarize articles from google.


For now, this code will be summarizing news articles about COVID-19.
