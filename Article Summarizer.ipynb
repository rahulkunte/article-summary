Putin: U.S. and NATO rejected Moscow’s demand to keep Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations out of NATO, halt weapons deployments near Russian borders . Putin said Russia is ready to engage in talks on limiting the deployment of intermediate range missiles in Europe . The announcement buoyed world financial markets and the long-suffering ruble after weeks of escalation .  Russian Defense Ministry did not indicate where the withdrawing troops had been deployed or how many were leaving . It released images of tanks and armored vehicles rolling onto a train, and a tank commander saluting his forces .

U.S. defense official: Russian ground units have been moving out of larger assembly areas for several days . Russian lawmakers urge Putin to recognize rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine as independent states . Moscow wants guarantees that NATO will not allow Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to join as members .  “We are really on the border, we really have relatives here and there, everyone has somebody there (on the Ukrainian side),” she said . “No one wants war. >”'"
